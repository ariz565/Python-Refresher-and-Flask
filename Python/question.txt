You are given an encrypted string (ciphertext) encoded using a Caesar cipher â€” where all alphabetic characters are shifted by the same amount. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

Your task is to decrypt the text by finding the correct shift, using a known word that appears in the original message.


---

ðŸ“¥ Input:

ciphertext (string): The encrypted message.

known_word (string): A word known to exist in the original message.



---

ðŸ“¤ Output:

Return the decrypted original string if the known word appears after decryption.

Return "Invalid" if no shift makes the known word appear in the message.

Input:

ciphertext = "Eqfkpi vguvu ctg hwp!"
known_word = "tests"

Output:

Coding tests are fun!

Input:

ciphertext = "cdeb nqxg"
known_word = "love"

Output:
