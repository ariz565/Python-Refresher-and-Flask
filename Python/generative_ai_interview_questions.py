Generative AI creates new content (text, images, code, audio) that resembles human-created content.

Key Differences:
Traditional AI:
- Classification and prediction tasks
- Discriminative models (tells you what something is)
- Rule-based or pattern recognition
- Output: Labels, categories, predictions

Generative AI:

Transformers are a neural network architecture introduced in "Attention Is All You Need" (2017).

Key Components:
1. Self-Attention Mechanism:

   - Parallel processing (vs sequential in RNNs)

2. Positional Encoding:
   - Adds position information to tokens
   - Helps understand word order

3. Multi-Head Attention:
   - Multiple attention mechanisms in parallel
   - Captures different types of relationships

4. Feed-Forward Networks:
   - Process attended information

Q48. What are diffusion models and how do they generate images?

Answer:
Diffusion models learn to reverse a gradual noising process to generate images.

Training Process:
1. Forward Diffusion (Noising):
   - Start with real image
   - Gradually add Gaussian noise over T steps
   - Eventually becomes pure noise

2. Reverse Diffusion (Denoising):
   - Train neural network to predict noise
   - Learn to reverse each noising step
   - Network takes noisy image + timestep → predicted noise

Generation Process:
1. Start with random noise
2. For each timestep t (from T to 1):
   - Predict noise using trained network
   - Remove predicted noise
   - Add small amount of random noise (except last step)
3. Result: Generated image

Mathematical Foundation:
- Forward: q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = N(x_t; √(1-β_t)x_{t-1}, β_t I)
- Reverse: p_θ(x_{t-1}|x_t) = N(x_{t-1}; μ_θ(x_t,t), Σ_θ(x_t,t))

Q61. How do you fine-tune a pre-trained language model?

Answer:
Fine-tuning adapts a pre-trained model to specific tasks or domains.

Steps for Fine-tuning:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Collect task-specific dataset
   - Format data for your use case
   - Split into train/validation/test
   - Tokenize using same tokenizer as base model

2. Model Setup:
   - Load pre-trained model
   - Add task-specific head (if needed)
   - Freeze/unfreeze appropriate layers

3. Training Configuration:
   - Lower learning rate than pre-training (1e-5 to 1e-4)
   - Smaller batch sizes
   - Fewer epochs (1-5 typically)
   - Gradient clipping to prevent instability

4. Training Process:
   - Monitor validation loss
   - Use early stopping
   - Save checkpoints
   - Log metrics

5. Evaluation:
   - Test on held-out data
   - Compare to baseline models
   - Analyze failure cases

Types of Fine-tuning:
- Full fine-tuning: Update all parameters
- Parameter-efficient: LoRA, adapters, prompt tuning
- In-context learning: No parameter updates

Q62. What is Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)?

Answer:
PEFT methods fine-tune large models by updating only a small subset of parameters.

Popular PEFT Methods:

1. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):
   - Add trainable low-rank matrices to existing weights
   - W' = W + BA (where A, B are low-rank)
   - Significantly reduces trainable parameters

2. Adapters:
   - Insert small neural networks between existing layers
   - Only train adapter parameters
   - Keep base model frozen

3. Prompt Tuning:
   - Learn continuous prompt embeddings
   - Prepend to input sequences
   - Very few parameters (~0.1% of model)

4. Prefix Tuning:
   - Similar to prompt tuning
   - Add trainable prefixes to key-value pairs

Benefits:
- Much faster training
- Lower memory requirements
- Easier to deploy multiple task-specific models
- Prevents catastrophic forgetting

Typical Parameter Reduction:
- Full fine-tuning: 100% of parameters
- LoRA: 0.1-1% of parameters
- Adapters: 2-4% of parameters
- Prompt tuning: 0.01-0.1% of parameters

   - Generate convincing false content
   - Difficult to detect AI-generated content
   - Potential for malicious use
   - Impact on trust in media

2. Bias and Fairness:
   - Training data contains societal biases
   - Amplifies existing inequalities
   - Unfair representation of groups
   - Discriminatory outputs

3. Privacy Concerns:
   - Models may memorize training data
   - Potential for data extraction attacks
   - Personal information leakage
   - Consent for data usage

4. Intellectual Property:
   - Training on copyrighted content
   - Generated content ownership
   - Artist and creator rights
   - Fair use boundaries

5. Economic Displacement:
   - Job automation concerns
   - Impact on creative industries
   - Writer, artist, programmer displacement
   - Economic inequality

6. Accountability and Transparency:

Q78. What is AI alignment and why is it important?

Answer:
AI alignment ensures that AI systems pursue goals that are beneficial to humans.

Why Alignment Matters:

1. Goal Specification:
   - AI systems optimize for specified objectives
   - Misaligned goals can lead to harmful outcomes
   - Need to capture human values accurately

2. Power and Capability:
   - AI systems becoming more powerful
   - Misaligned powerful systems are dangerous
   - Difficult to correct after deployment

3. Scalability:
   - Alignment problems worsen with scale
   - Need solutions that work for AGI
   - Current alignment is insufficient for future systems

Alignment Approaches:

1. Reward Modeling:
   - Learn human preferences from feedback
   - Train reward models from human rankings
   - Use reward models to guide AI behavior

2. Constitutional AI:
   - Define principles for AI behavior
   - Train models to follow these principles
   - Self-supervision using constitutional rules

3. Interpretability:
   - Understand how AI makes decisions
   - Identify potential misalignment
   - Enable correction and improvement

4. Robustness:
   - Ensure alignment across different contexts
   - Handle distribution shift
   - Maintain alignment under pressure

Challenges:
- Value specification difficulty
- Goodhart's law (optimizing metrics ≠ achieving goals)
- Distributional shift
- Deceptive alignment
- Scalable oversight
